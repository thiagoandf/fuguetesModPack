# Fuguetes ModPack

This is a basic ModPack with mostly quality of life improvements to the game.

## Installation

This modpack uses the Forge mod loader and Minecraft 1.16.1

You can install in your client by following the instructions [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.1.html). We recommend you use the normal Mojang's Minecraft Launcher installation, but any other installation options will work as well.

After installing Forge, you need to add the .jar files to the mods folder.

On Windows, by default, here:
```sh
C:\Users\{Your User}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
```

On Linux, by default, here:
```sh
~/.minecraft/mods
```
